Tross Maintenance – Architecture Diagrams (mermaid)
Canvas is not supported in shared conversations

I turned your write-up into clean, editable Mermaid diagrams (high-level, data flow, deployment, and security). They’re on the canvas—ready for tweaks or export to PNG/SVG, PlantUML, or draw.io.

If you want, I can also add C4 views or a payment/dispatch sequence diagram next.

This is a conversation between ChatGPT and Jacob Johnson. Responding will create a branch.


ChatGPT can make mistakes. OpenAI doesn't use Kin Living AI workspace data to train its models.
